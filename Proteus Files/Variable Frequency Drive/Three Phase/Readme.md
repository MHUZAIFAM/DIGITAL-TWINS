# Variable Frequency Drive for three Phase AC 220V RMS Voltages

### Design 1.1: Three Phase Rectifier
*It uses 220V AC RMS value and passes through diodes to produce 311V DC Voltage*

### Design 1.2 Three Phase SPWM via MCU
*Using MCU to produce SPWM(Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation) each with the phase shift of 120 degrees*

### Design 1.3 Three Phase Inverter via MOSFETs
*Using IRF2104 as they dont have built-in dead time for switching of MOSFETS, to create sunosoidal wave*

### Design 1.4 Three Phase VFD (Complete DESIGN)
